# Karta

**Karta** is a reusable SDK for building public-interest geospatial layer platforms — a domain-agnostic layer model, generic map rendering, and React hooks that any dataset can be wired into, with no accounts and no tracking beyond cookieless page views. `@karta/core`, `@karta/map`, and `@karta/react` are the SDK itself; it doesn't encode any particular geography or story.

`packages/app` and `packages/web` are a reference implementation proving the SDK out end-to-end with one real, published domain: **Gauteng spatial legacy**, mapping apartheid-era spatial planning legacy across South African cities. That's just the first domain built on the SDK — a different one could map flood risk, public amenities, or anything else. See [`docs/domains/gauteng-spatial-legacy.md`](docs/domains/gauteng-spatial-legacy.md) for what it covers, why it exists, and how its per-metro area data is classified.

## Stack

React + TypeScript SSR app (React Router framework mode on Vite, `react-leaflet`, Zustand, Zod, vanilla-extract) split into six npm workspace packages — `@karta/core`, `@karta/map`, `@karta/react`, `@karta/theme`, `@karta/app`, and `@karta/web` — plus a Node/TypeScript offline data pipeline (public OSRM for routing, Overpass API + open data portals for transit, no Docker/GDAL required), and Cloudflare Workers for edge rendering and asset delivery. No accounts and no tracking beyond cookieless page views.
